# 2D NearField-mmWaveSAR-Imaging
Nearfield mmWave imaging of a remote object using SAR method over K-band frequency.
2D Nearfield SAR CST model is created for data collection, signal reflection. Further these data are used for image reconstruction.
Rawdata: Collected from CST MW Studio
Code: MATLAB

File: mmWaveSAR.m is used for mmWave image reconstruction
Rawdata: Data18GHz.mat

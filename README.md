# NearField-mmWaveSAR-Imaging
Nearfield mmWave imaging of a remote object using SAR method over K-band frequency.
Nearfield SAR CST mode is created for data collection and then for signal processing
Rawdata: Collected from CST MW Studio
Code: MATLAB

File: mmWaveSAR.m is used for mmWave image reconstruction
Rawdata: Data18GHz.mat
